Summary

Project origin

This is a project I completed while experimenting with computer vision.

Overview of the game

This is a rock, paper, scissors game made on a HP Laptop with the native webcam.

The pictures taken by the webcam were used to generated a ML model using Teachable Machine. The Tensorflow model and label provided by Teachable Machine is then utilised to program the game on Python.

Milestone 1: Building the ML Model on Teachable Machine

We create an image project model with four classes namely: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing.
